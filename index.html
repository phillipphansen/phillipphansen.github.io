                     <h2>Biography</h2>
                     <p>I am a transplant to the Omaha area under the direction of Uncle Sam. I speak Korean and am currently serving as an <a href="https://www.airforce.com/careers/detail/airborne-cryptologic-language-analyst">Airborne Cryptologic Language Analyst</a> in the US Air Force. I am currently working on getting a BMS in Management Information Systems while serving, while my wife just completed her master's program in Marriage and Family Therapy at UNL. I can't let her get too far ahead of me, can I?</p>
                     <p>I worked in the coffee industry during college before enlisting in the Air Force. I sold beans in bulk from a myriad of roasters and origins, and cultivated a life-long appreciation for the taste of coffee, not just for its admirable caffeinated qualities. I brew it by hand every morning and am your expert source if you're interested in taking the red pill and abandoning that pre-ground tin of dirt in your cupboard in favor of some quality beans!</p>
                     <p>My wife and I find ourselves exceptionally busy with our academics and jobs, however we try to make time for ourselves to have fun when we can! As south-westerners, we don't do much during the winters around here, but we thoroughly enjoy the spring, summer and fall. With hiking trips planned often in the spring to take advantage of the greenery and cool weather, we like doing things outdoors. During the summer, we love floating Nebraska's many rivers with a cooler full of beer and sandwiches.</p>
                     <p>When doing things without my wife, I enjoy hobby programming, and computer maintenance and repair. I also engage in amateur astronomy with my little 3.5&quot; Newtonian telescope, and amateur radio using a modified Wi-Fi card, called an <a href="https://www.rtl-sdr.com/">RTL2832U</a>, as a software defined radio to pick up all kinds of  radio activity! My favorite band to listen to is air AM in the 110-140MHz range. That's where you'll hear aircraft and towers all communicating with each other.</p>
